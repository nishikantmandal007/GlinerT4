# Pipeline-side optimizations from the T4 plan, gliner2 2.1.0 — 2026-10-25

This round applies the **no-semantic-change, Phase 1** items of
`GLiNER_Multilingual_v2_1_T4_Optimization_Plan.docx` to the GLiNER2 path (`fastino/gliner2-multi-v1`, `gliner2==2.1.0`).
That path measured 54.81 chunks/s on one T4. The code and the CPU checks are done. **T4 numbers are pending**: this
session had no GPU and no Hugging Face access. Run the benchmark below and fill in "T4 results".

## What the existing T4 profile actually says

The baseline profile (`../colab_2026-10-24/t4_optimization/logs/gliner2-baseline.log`, 97 chunks × 3 passes) was
re-read:

- **"Span unpacking" (0.717 s self time in `models/base.py:469 unpack`) is the GPU, not CPU work.** gliner2's packed
  encoder path does `padded[mask] = states` with a boolean mask, which forces a device-to-host sync. Everything the
  encoder queued finishes inside that call, so its "self time" is the host waiting for the encoder kernels. The earlier
  assessment listed it as CPU work to optimize; that was wrong and has been corrected there.
- The real host-side work between GPU batches is:
  - batch collation: `collate_fn_inference`, 0.58 s cumulative, of which `_format_input_with_mapping` is 0.26 s;
  - the count/span head: `_compute_direct_span_logits_batched`, 0.33 s;
  - decoding and formatting.

  These times come from cProfile, which inflates Python-heavy code, so treat them as upper bounds.
- **GPU-busy ceiling.** The profile recorded 1.28 s of CUDA kernel time for 97 chunks. The clean baseline's wall time
  for that many chunks is about 1.77 s (5.29 s / 290 × 97). So the GPU is busy roughly 70% of the time.
  - Perfect CPU/GPU overlap with today's GPU work would reach about 75 chunks/s, not 100.
  - 100 chunks/s also needs about 25% less GPU time per chunk.
  - The kernel split was GEMMs about 48% (cuBLAS, near optimal), custom attention about 25%, elementwise about 15%.

  `pipeline_bench.py` measures the busy fraction directly, without the profiler-inflated Python time.

## What was built

| Item (plan section) | Change | Accuracy status |
|---|---|---|
| CPU/GPU pipeline overlap (Phase 1) | `serving/gliner2_pipeline.py`: a copy of gliner2 2.1.0's `batch_extract`. A helper thread runs the same collator over the same batches, in the same order, up to `depth` batches ahead, while the serving thread runs the model. Turned on with `gliner2_pipeline.install(depth)`. Refuses to install on any other gliner2 version. | Identical by construction: the same batches reach the model. The copy was diffed against the 2.1.0 source; the only change is the prefetch wrapper. `tests/test_gliner2_pipeline.py` passes on CPU: outputs `==` stock (every confidence float, span and order) for batch 1/7/16, depth 1/2/4, `batch_extract_entities` and `_long`, and two concurrent serving threads. Collation errors reach the caller and no helper threads leak. |
| Collation in worker processes (Phase 1) | No code change: gliner2's own `num_workers` DataLoader option, called through `batch_extract`. | Identical on the stand-in model; checked again on T4 by the benchmark. |
| Microbatch sweep (Phase 1) | Batch 8 / 16 / 32 in the benchmark. | **Not zero-loss.** Batch composition changes padding and kernel shapes. On the CPU stand-in, batch 8 already changed raw outputs (all kept values were still equal). On T4 it is accepted only if the full-output parity column says `True`. |
| Measurement (Phase 0 / plan §8) | `bench/pipeline_bench.py`: interleaved trials of every config; full-output and kept-value parity against the baseline; per-stage breakdown (collate, H2D, encoder, embeddings, span head, decode, format); GPU-busy fraction from `torch.profiler`. | — |

Not done in this round, with reasons:

- **INT8 / other precisions:** ruled out by the zero-loss requirement.
- **Gzip:** rejected by the plan itself.
- **FlashDeBERTa:** gliner2 2.1.0 reads `USE_FLASHDEBERTA` and the `flashdeberta` package. The env var in the plan
  document is `gliner`'s. The current path already uses fused attention (disentangled_flash plus the custom sm_75
  kernel), so this is a separate encoder experiment.
- **CUDA Graphs:** the packed encoder path syncs on the host (the `unpack` above). Graph capture needs those syncs
  removed first.
- **Fusing LayerNorm/GELU/residual:** remains the next GPU-side target (about 15% elementwise time).

## Reproduce

CPU check (no GPU or Hub needed):

```
pip install "gliner2[local]==2.1.0" torch
python tests/test_gliner2_pipeline.py                 # prints PASS
python bench/pipeline_bench.py --standin --corpus <corpus.json> --out /tmp/smoke --trials 1   # harness smoke test
```

T4 benchmark on Colab (single-file runner, as with the earlier Colab runs):

```
python bench/make_colab_pipeline_bench.py --trials 3  # writes artifacts/colab_pipeline_bench.py (corpus embedded)
colab run artifacts/colab_pipeline_bench.py           # on a T4 runtime; prints result.json and summary.md between markers
```

On the VM instead: `python bench/pipeline_bench.py --corpus <290-chunk corpus.json> --out <dir>`, from the repo root,
with the VM venv.

## T4 results

_Pending: to be filled from `results/result.json` and `results/summary.md` of the T4 run._
